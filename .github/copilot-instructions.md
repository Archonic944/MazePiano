## Class Documentation

### Game Class (`game.js`)
**Purpose**: Main game controller that orchestrates all game systems.

**Key Properties**:
- `player` - Player instance
- `camera` - Camera instance
- `tileSystem` - TileSystem instance
- `keys` - Object tracking pressed keys
- `lightOverlay` - Image for the light effect rendered behind the player

**Key Methods**:
- `init()` - Initializes event listeners and starts game loop
- `bindEvents()` - Sets up keyboard input handling
- `update()` - Updates all game systems each frame
- `render()` - Renders all visual elements with camera transformations
- `renderBackground()` - Fills the background with solid black color
- `renderLightOverlay()` - Renders the light effect centered on player
- `gameLoop()` - Main game loop using requestAnimationFrame

**Canvas Context**: Uses global `canvas` and `ctx` variables for rendering.

### Player Class (`Player.js`)
**Purpose**: Handles player character movement, animation, and rendering.

**Key Properties**:
- `x, y` - World position coordinates (center of player)
- `spawnX, spawnY` - Original spawn position for respawning
- `width, height` - Player sprite dimensions (32x32 pixels)
- `hitboxWidth, hitboxHeight` - Player collision hitbox dimensions (20x20 pixels, smaller than sprite)
- `speed` - Movement speed in pixels per second (270)
- `direction` - Current facing direction ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right')
- `isMoving` - Boolean tracking movement state
- `animationTime` - Timer for sprite animation frames
- `isDead` - Boolean tracking death state
- `deathTime` - Timer for death animation
- `deathFlashDuration` - Duration of death animation in seconds
- `sprites` - Object storing loaded sprite images
- `deathSound` - Audio object for death sound effect

**Key Methods**:
- `loadSprites()` - Loads all player sprite images from public/sprites/
- `update(keys, tileSystem)` - Processes input, updates position/animation, and checks collisions
- `checkWallCollision(x, y, tileSystem)` - Returns true if position would collide with stone tiles (uses hitbox size for collision)
- `checkSpikeCollision(tileSystem)` - Checks for spike collision at hitbox center and triggers death
- `die()` - Plays death sound and teleports player back to spawn
- `getCurrentSprite()` - Returns appropriate sprite based on direction and movement
- `render(ctx)` - Draws player sprite centered on hitbox, with flipping for left direction

**Input Handling**: Responds to WASD and arrow keys for movement.

**Collision System**:
- Wall collision: Checks all four corners of player hitbox (24x24) against stone tiles, allowing player to fit through 1-tile-wide gaps
- Spike collision: Checks player hitbox center position against spike tiles
- Movement is prevented if collision with walls would occur
- Spike collision triggers immediate death and respawn

**Death/Respawn System**:
- Player dies when touching spike tiles
- Death state is set (isDead = true)
- Death plays `death_sfx.mp3` sound effect
- Screen flashes red for a brief period (deathFlashDuration)
- Controls are disabled during death animation
- After animation completes, player teleports back to spawn position

**Animation System**: 
- Idle sprites for each direction
- 2-frame walking animation for each direction
- Left movement uses horizontally flipped right sprites

### Camera Class (`Camera.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages viewport and provides smooth following with zoom support.

**Key Properties**:
- `x, y` - Camera world position
- `zoom` - Zoom level (default 1.5 for closer view)
- `smoothing` - Interpolation factor for smooth following (0.1)

**Key Methods**:
- `follow(target)` - Smoothly follows target entity (usually player)

**Camera Behavior**:
- Centers on target with zoom consideration
- Uses linear interpolation for smooth movement
- Zoom affects both rendering scale and follow calculations

### TileSystem Class (`TileSystem.js`)
**Purpose**: Manages tile-based world with different tile types and efficient rendering.

**Key Properties**:
- `tileSize` - Size of each tile in pixels (32, matching player size)
- `sprites` - Object storing tile sprite images
- `tiles` - Map storing tile data as "x,y" -> tileType
- `revealedTiles` - 2D array tracking which tiles are visible to the player

**Key Methods**:
- `loadSprites()` - Loads tile sprites (stone.png, coin.png, spike.png)
- `generateSampleTiles()` - Creates demo level with walls, coins, and spikes
- `generateMaze()` - Generates a maze using randomized depth-first search, sets up walls, air tiles, start/end flags, and revealed edges
- `setTile(x, y, tileType)` - Places/removes tiles at grid coordinates
- `getTile(x, y)` - Returns tile type at grid coordinates
- `worldToTile(worldX, worldY)` - Converts world position to tile coordinates
- `tileToWorld(tileX, tileY)` - Converts tile coordinates to world position
- `render(ctx, camera)` - Efficiently renders only visible and revealed tiles
- `renderTile(ctx, x, y, tileType)` - Renders individual tile with sprite or fallback

**Optimization**: Only renders tiles visible in current camera view to maintain performance.

### Constants (`constants.js`)
**TILE_TYPES Enum**:
- `AIR: 0` - Empty space (no tile)
- `STONE: 1` - Solid wall tile
- `COIN: 2` - Collectible coin tile
- `SPIKE: 3` - Hazard spike tile
- `START_FLAG: 4` - Starting point tile
- `END_FLAG: 5` - End point tile

## Rendering Pipeline

### Render Order (back to front):
1. **Background** - Solid black background
2. **Tiles** - Stone walls, coins, spikes from TileSystem (only revealed tiles)
3. **Light Overlay** - Glowing light effect centered on player
4. **Player** - Character sprite with animations

### Camera Transformations:
1. Clear canvas
2. Save context state
3. Apply zoom scaling
4. Apply camera translation
5. Render all world objects
6. Restore context state

## Input System
- **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Key Tracking**: `keys` object stores current pressed state
- **Events**: keydown/keyup listeners update key states
- **Processing**: Player.update() reads key states each frame

## Coordinate Systems

### World Coordinates
- Absolute positions in the game world
- Player and tiles use world coordinates
- Camera tracks world position

### Tile Coordinates
- Grid-based coordinates (0,0), (1,0), etc.
- Each tile is 32x32 pixels in world space
- Used for tile placement and collision detection

### Screen Coordinates
- Canvas pixel positions after camera transformation
- Handled automatically by canvas context transformations

## Visibility System

### Tile Revealing Mechanics
- **Wall Revealing**: Adjacent wall (STONE) tiles are automatically revealed as the player moves
- **Spike Revealing**: Spike tiles are only revealed after the player dies from stepping on them
- **Initial Visibility**: Only border walls and starting area are initially visible
- **Implementation**: Uses `revealedTiles` 2D array in `TileSystem` class to track visibility state
- **Rendering Control**: Only revealed tiles are rendered in the render method

## Performance Considerations

### Tile Culling
- Only renders tiles visible in camera viewport
- Calculates visible tile range based on camera position and zoom
- Prevents unnecessary rendering of off-screen tiles
- Further optimized by only rendering revealed tiles

### Sprite Loading
- Sprites loaded asynchronously
- Fallback colored rectangles while sprites load
- `sprite.complete` check before rendering

### Animation Efficiency
- Fixed 60 FPS delta time for consistent movement
- Animation timers only update when moving
- Efficient sprite selection logic

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tile Types
1. Add new constant to `TILE_TYPES` in `constants.js`
2. Add sprite loading in `TileSystem.loadSprites()`
3. Add fallback color in `getTileFallbackColor()`
4. Place tiles using `setTile()` method

### Adding New Player Features
- Modify `Player.update()` for new behaviors
- Add new sprites to `loadSprites()` if needed
- Update `getCurrentSprite()` for new animations
- Consider adding new properties for state tracking
- If changing collision behavior, update `hitboxWidth`/`hitboxHeight` and collision methods to match desired gameplay

### Camera Enhancements
- Adjust `zoom` property for different zoom levels
- Modify `smoothing` for different follow speeds
- Add camera bounds by modifying `follow()` method

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor tile render count in console
- Consider object pooling for frequent allocations
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Implement frustum culling for complex scenes

## Common Patterns

### Entity Structure
All game entities should have:
- Position properties (x, y)
- Dimension properties (width, height)
- Update method for logic
- Render method for drawing

### Resource Loading
- Load assets asynchronously
- Provide fallback rendering
- Check `.complete` property before using images

### State Management
- Use boolean flags for simple states
- Use enums for multiple states
- Update state in update() methods
- React to state in render() methods

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
- Collision detection between player and tiles
- Sound effects for interactions
- Multiple levels/maps
- Game state management (menu, game over, etc.)
- Save/load functionality

### Scalability
- Consider component-based entity system for complex entities
- Implement proper game state management
- Add level loading from external files
- Consider using TypeScript for better type safety

### Code Organization
- Keep classes focused on single responsibilities
- Use composition over inheritance
- Maintain clear separation between logic and rendering
- Document public APIs thoroughly
